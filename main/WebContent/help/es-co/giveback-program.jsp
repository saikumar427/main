<p><em>1. How do I qualify for this program? </em></p>
<p>A. If you are hosting a charity, non-profit or school event in which its sole purpose is not dedicated to making a profit, sign up for a free Eventbee account with the promotional code GOOD and start receiving your 25% discount.</p>
<p><em>2. Do I need to submit any paper work?<br>
</em><br>
A. No we don't ask you to submit any paper work. We don't believe in giving you more work when you are already busy managing your event!</p>
<p><em>3. How long this program is valid?<br>
</em><br>
A. We are planning to run this program entire 2011, so all events you are hosting in 2011 will get 25% discount in service fee.</p>
