                a Eventbee online software (the &quot;Services&quot;) to give 
                us contact information. Depending on the services chosen, we ask 
                for contact and account information, such as name, company name, 
                address, phone number, e-mail address, password , in addition 
                to financial and billing information, such as billing name, address 
                and credit card number. When you express interest in additional 
                information, when you register for the Services, or after you 
                become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, 
                such as title, mobile number, fax number or additional company 
                information, such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. 
                You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering 
                it when asked. </p>
                <p>Eventbee does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses, 
                  except as noted in its Terms of Service, or as may be required 
                  by law.</p>
                <p>Eventbee uses the information we collect to set up the Services 
                  for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the 
                  information to contact customers and prospects to further discuss 
                  their interest in our company, the Services we provide and ways 
                  we can improve them, and to send information such as announcements 
                  of promotions and events regarding our company or partners. 
                  We may also e-mail a customer newsletter and updates about the 
                  Services or the company. You can opt out of receiving these 
                  communications by replying to them at the time they are distributed 
                  or at any time by <a href="javascript:;" class="emailus">e-mailing us</a>.</p>
                <p>All financial and billing information that we collect through 
                  a Eventbee Web site and the Services is used solely to bill 
                  for the Services. Eventbee does not use this billing information 
                  for marketing or promotional purposes. Except as we explicitly 
                  state at the time we request information, or as provided for 
                  in the Eventbee Terms of Service, we do not disclose to any 
                  third party the information provided.</p>
                <p>Eventbee has referral relationships with third-party companies 
                  and individuals (&quot;Referral Partners&quot;) who refer their 
                  customers to Eventbee. Customers who become paying users of 
                  a Eventbee online software through a Referral Partner are considered 
                  customers of both Eventbee and the Referral Partner. Eventbee 
                  and a Referral Partner may share customer contact as well as 
                  account, financial and billing information with respect to their 
                  joint business relationship with the customer. The sharing of 
                  this information allows Eventbee and the Referral Partner to 
                  establish the identity of the shared customer and determine 
                  referral fees owed. This sharing also allows Referral Partners 
                  to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer. 
                  Shared contact and account, financial and billing information 
                  is governed by the Eventbee Terms of Service. Eventbee does 
                  not share your business data with Referral Partners.</p>
                <p>Eventbee has integration relationships with third-party companies 
                  and individuals (&quot;Partners&quot;). These relationships 
                  extend the functionality of the Services and the Integration 
                  Partner application or service (&quot;Integrated Service&quot;) 
                  by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange 
                  customer data and to establish linked business processes between 
                  the two. Customers who pay Eventbee for use of the Services 
                  and use this Integrated Service are considered customers of 
                  both Eventbee and the Partner. Eventbee and Partner may share 
                  customer contact, account, financial and billing information, 
                  and business data with respect to their integrated business 
                  relationship with the customer. The sharing of this information 
                  allows Eventbee and the Partner to establish the identity of 
                  the shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing 
                  also allows the Partner to provide consolidated billing services 
                  to the shared customer and allows for the enhanced functionality 
                  of the integrated service. Shared contact, account, financial 
                  and billing information, and business data is governed by the 
                  Eventbee Terms of Service.</p>
                <p>Eventbee uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card 
                  processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution 
                  chain and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information 
                  provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. 
                  Eventbee does not store customer credit card information on 
                  its servers.</p>
                <p>
                  Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide 
                  information on a Eventbee Web site, but they are not permitted 
                  to collect any information, nor does Eventbee share any personally 
                  identifiable user information with these parties.</p>
                <p>Eventbee customers use Eventbee online software to host data 
                  and information. Eventbee will not review, share, distribute, 
                  print, or reference any such data except as provided in the 
                  Eventbee Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. We 
                  will view or access individual records only with your permission 
                  (for example, to resolve a problem or support issue). Of course, 
                  users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality 
                  and security of their user registration and passwords.</p>
                <p>Eventbee may also collect certain information from visitors 
                  to a Eventbee Web site and customers of the Services, such as 
                  Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose 
                  technical problems and to administer the Eventbee Web site and 
                  Services in order to constantly improve quality. We may also 
                  track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume 
                  statistical information from visitors and customers and provide 
                  such information to third parties.<br>

                Services are accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet 
                Explorer versions 4.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology 
                protects information using both server authentication and data 
                encryption to help ensure data is safe, secure and available only 
                to you. Eventbee also implements an advanced security method based 
                on dynamic data and encoded session identifications and hosts 
                the Services in a secure server environment using a firewall and 
                other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from 
                outside intruders. Finally, Eventbee requires unique user names 
                and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. 
                These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
