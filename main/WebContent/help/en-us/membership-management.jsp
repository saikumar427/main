<p><b>Eventbee provides three types of communities:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> <i>Public Community,</i> any one can join this community, visible across Eventbee<br></li>
<li><i>Moderated Community,</i> joining this community requires manager's approval</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Which type of community is right for me?</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p> - If you are building community to promote your events to broader audience, 
we recommend you to build Public Community<br>
<br>
- If you are building niche community and restrict who to allow 
etc. build Moderated Community<br>
<br>
- If you already have association, club or special interest 
group with paid memberships, we recommend you to use Paid Community 
to streamline your membership management operations</p>
